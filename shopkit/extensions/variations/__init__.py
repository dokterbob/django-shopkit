Base classes for `Product`, `Cart` and `OrderItem` models which have several
variations. The base classes have no natural properties or fields, these
have to be defined in the application which uses the variations.

Within the models module, two kinds of models are defined:

1. Unordered variations.
2. Ordered variations - for which an integer ordering has to be
   specified.
