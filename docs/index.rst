Welcome to django-webshop's documentation!
==========================================

Webshop framework for Django
----------------------------
Similar to the way that Django is a web application framework, django-webshop
is a webshop application framework. It is, essentially, a toolkit for
building customized webshop applications, for 'perfectionists with deadlines'.

Compatibility
-------------
This piece of software will be compatible with Django 1.3. Due to the 
unavailability of Class Based Generic Views, it will not work on earlier
releases.

Dependencies
------------
You will need the dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt` to be installed
somewhere in your `PYTHONPATH`.
