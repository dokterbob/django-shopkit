Example applications
====================

`django-webshop` will ship with two example implementations of webshops. These can be installed
as a ready-made package; only the templates and configuration should need further refinement.

The first available demo application will be `basic_webshop`. As the name suggests, we have
attempted to provide a very basic webshop here - with simple categories, prices and currencies.

Later, an `advanced_webshop` package should be included, showing off some of the more advanced
features of `django-webshop`.
