Webshops for perfectionists with deadlines
------------------------------------------
Similar to the way that Django is a web application framework, django-shopkit
is a webshop application framework. It is, essentially, a toolkit for
building customized webshop applications, for 'perfectionists with deadlines'.

Project status
--------------
The current codebase of `django-shopkit` is currently used to run at least two
shops in a production environment, where it performs just fine. However, there
is an apparent lack of documentation, which we hope to fix during the upcoming
months while unrolling subsequent webshop implementations.

If you are interested in using `django-shopkit` for building your own webshop
application, please 
`contact us <mailto:mathijs@mathijsfietst.nl>`_ and we'll see how we can work together in helping you understand shopkit's internals while laying out a
documentation trail in the meanwhile.
