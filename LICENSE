**Eventually**, we should get this stuff out as AGPL. 

However, **for now**, consider it to be closed source code for which you have explicit permission to copy for personal use only, without sharing. Also consider that at this stage you are **explicitly forbidden** to use this for any commercial application until you've make significant contributions, which should be specificly acknowledged by myself (or perhaps some other contributor at some later stage).

As you contribute code, you will be added to the list of copyright holders of that specific file and will be asked to comply with this simple license. Also, you will be mentioned as a core contributor in the documentation, once we have some of it.
