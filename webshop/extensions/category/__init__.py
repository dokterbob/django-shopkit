Django-webshop, by default, contains base classes for two kinds of categories:

* Simple categories, which define a base class for products that belong to
  exactly one category.
* Advanced categories, that belong to zero or more categories.

Furthermore, generic abstract base models are defined for 'normal' categories
and for nested categories, allowing for the hierarchical categorization of
products.
